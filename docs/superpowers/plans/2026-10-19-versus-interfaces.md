# Versus — shared interfaces and constraints for the four plans

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-19-versus-tug-of-war-design.md` (approved by the owner
2026-10-19, amended 2026-10-20 night). Eight plans implement it and all build against the names below:

| Plan | File | What it builds | Repo / branch |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `2026-10-19-versus-a-tug-and-bench.md` | the tug course, string, bout and match physics, ranking direction, the tug's pages and clips (Plan E replaced its winch bench by the rating against the reference duck) | arena, branch `versus` |
| B | `2026-10-19-versus-b-tug-recipe.md` | the `tug_of_war` training recipe, the trainings, the first candidate, the publish CLI's line for a tug entry | microduck-challenges, branch `tug-of-war`; microduck_rl, branch `tug-publish-line` |
| C | `2026-10-19-versus-c-weekly-cup.md` | calendar, entrants, secret, draw, groups, knockout, cup records, secrecy, match clips, cup and match pages, points, premiere on the live | arena, branch `versus` |
| D | `2026-10-19-versus-d-cup-show.md` | the show: running order with the desk, play-by-play, tournament-aware writer, desk screen | arena, branch `versus` |
| E | `2026-10-20-versus-e-reference-bouts.md` | the rating by five bouts against the reference duck, 45 s bouts, the winch removed | arena, branch `versus` |
| F | `2026-10-20-versus-f-opponent-training.md` | training against a frozen opponent duck, the reference first; the publish line in cm | microduck-challenges, branch `tug-of-war`; microduck_rl, branch `tug-publish-line` |
| G | `2026-10-21-versus-g-ring-and-rope.md` | the 3 m wrestling ring whose ropes are the field's edges, the physical string, the judge on its middle, the string recorded, served and drawn, the venue bound to the ring | arena, branch `versus` |
| H | `2026-10-21-versus-h-upright-on-the-ring.md` | the recipe on the ring and the string, the "stay upright" knob, the upright reference | microduck-challenges, branch `tug-of-war` |

A section's names are owned by the plan that introduces them; a later plan uses them as written
here. If a plan must change a name, it changes this file in the same commit.

## Global constraints (every task of every plan)

- **Commits, PRs, GitHub:** English only, never signed: no `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with
  Claude Code". Commit subjects read like the repo's (a sentence saying what changes for a person).
- **English only** in code, comments, UI, docs, clips and commentary. A stage run is a
  "performance"; the cup's broadcast is the "show".
- **Nothing leaves this Mac without the owner's yes**: no push, no wheel upload, no Space dataset
  write, no Hub publish. Exception granted by the owner on 2026-10-19: **HF Jobs trainings for
  Plans B and F under the owner's account (Nico-robot) have no budget limit.** Everything is pushed
  together at the end (Plan D's last task lists the release steps; each needs the owner's yes).
- **Order of execution:** A, then C, then D on one branch `versus` in one worktree. B starts once
  Plan A's Task 3 is committed (it names the commit B needs) and runs alongside, in the challenges
  repo; B's steps that run `arena score` on a tug wait for A's Task 5. B's Task 13 changes the
  publish CLI in microduck_rl (worktree branch `tug-publish-line` from `challenge-recipe-publishing`);
  D's release pushes it before the challenges relock. Stages 2–3 never wait for a good policy: tests
  use the vendored walker and fakes, the local rehearsals use B's intermediate checkpoints.
  **From 2026-10-20 night:** Plan F Task 1 (the winch out of the recipe) → Plan E Tasks 1–8 → Plan F
  Tasks 2–8 (Task 7: trainings t8/t9 on HF Jobs, in the background) → while they train, Plan C
  Tasks 8–14 → Plan D → Plan F Task 9 at release. E's Tasks 2 and 4 bring the challenges' pins along
  in the same sitting (`BOUT_S = 45.0`; `compile_tug(EVENT)`, `tug_layout(EVENT.course)`), so F's
  Tasks 2–9 call the one-argument forms. **From 2026-10-21:** Plan G Task 1 any time first; G2 → G3 → G4
  back to back (from G2's commit the challenges' parity tests are red, until Plan H Task 2; nothing
  trains in between); Plan H Tasks 1–5 after G4, G5–G8 beside them; G9 with Plan H Task 6, in one
  sitting; Plan H Task 7 after G9.
- **Settled by the owner (2026-10-20), no question to ask:** only the pit decides
  (a fall no longer loses: the earlier "a fall loses" ruling of the same day was reversed that
  evening, a downed duck stays in play and can be dragged in); HF Jobs trainings stay on l4x1; the first candidate's repo is
  `Nico-robot/microduck-tug-of-war` unless the owner names another at publish time; cup #1's Friday
  is set at release (D's release step asks); about 150 LLM router calls per cup are acceptable; on
  air a duck is named by its on-air `name` (Plan C's `Entrant.name`: the policy's name, plus
  ` (@<user>)` when another entrant of the cup has the same policy name) (match titles, clip cards,
  the match page's stamp, the cup screen, the desk and the call lines), the cup page shows the
  policy's name and the player's handle; the run page's stamp `RATED`, the lime round card with
  `Pull!`; 45 s bouts, a rating of five bouts against a frozen reference duck in cm with a pit
  bonus, no winch (2026-10-20 night).
- **Worktree (arena):** `~/Projects/HuggingFace/microduck-arena/.claude/worktrees/versus`, branch
  `versus` from local `main` at `abcbb9e` or later. From the main checkout:
  - `/usr/bin/git worktree add .claude/worktrees/versus -b versus main`
  - `cd .claude/worktrees/versus && uv sync --no-config --frozen --extra dev && (cd app && npm ci)`
- **Local main carries someone else's uncommitted edits** (`app/public/race.css`,
  `app/src/{main,router,router.test,share,share.test}.js`). Never stash, reset, commit or overwrite
  them; the worktree starts from the committed `main` and does not see them. The one exception is
  Plan D's release step 1, on the owner's yes: it holds them aside for the fast-forward and puts
  them back, checked hunk by hunk.
- **git:** always `/usr/bin/git` (the RTK hook's `git` rewrite is refused inside a worktree).
- **uv:** always `uv run --no-config --frozen …`. If `uv.lock` changes by accident:
  `/usr/bin/git checkout -- uv.lock`.
- **Shell inside the worktree:** no globs and no shell variables inside git, uv and npm commands;
  write paths out in full.
- **Tests run in the FOREGROUND**, one Bash call with `timeout: 600000`; never in the background,
  never "waiting for" a run. Python suite, two calls:
  1. `uv run --no-config --frozen --extra dev pytest -q -m "not network" -p no:cacheprovider tests/workshop`
  2. `uv run --no-config --frozen --extra dev pytest -q -m "not network" -p no:cacheprovider tests --ignore=tests/workshop`
  Front end: `cd app && npm test`; the only accepted failures are the 4 known ones in
  `src/brightness.test.js`. One file: `cd app && npx vitest run src/<file>.test.js`. The rtk filter
  hides vitest's unhandled-rejection report: use `rtk proxy npx vitest run` when counting.
- **Untouched:** the golden run (`arena/golden.py`), `RUNNER_VERSION` (stays 4), the 61-D
  observation and 13-number command, every existing event's physics and stored runs. A lone duck,
  a lane and a stage compile and run bit-identically (the existing tests in `test_course.py`,
  `test_run_stage.py`, `test_evaluate.py` stay green unchanged).
- **No dead code, no just-in-case generality** (owner's standing rule). Versus machinery that the
  tug of war does not use is not written.
- **x86 is the truth:** official ratings and cups are computed on the Space. Never compare a Mac
  run to a Space run; tests pin behaviour, not Space numbers.
- **Booth text** is never filtered by a script; fix bad lines in the prompt. Jokes must land for
  newcomers (no private running gags).
- **New pages** look like the Arena's own pages: few buttons, only what is needed when it is needed.

## Codebase facts the plans rely on

- Physics: `TIMESTEP=0.005`, `DECIMATION=4`, `CTRL_DT=0.02` (50 Hz), `TRACE_WIDTH=21`
  (`frame[0:3]` trunk position, `[3:7]` quaternion w,x,y,z, `[7:21]` the 14 joints in
  `JOINT_NAMES`). `arena/course.py`: `_inject_course` (one static `course` body: an infinite
  `floor` plane, plus `wall_boxes` for a lane), `_robot(rig)`, `build_course_xml`, `_motorized`,
  `_compiled`, `compile_course`, `duck_prefix(k)` (`""` / `"duck{k}/"`), `compile_stage(manifest,
  layout)` (duck 0 from `build_course_xml`, others attached on a frame, keyframe patched after
  compile). `arena/runner.py`: `_Addresses.of`, `_streams(event_id, seed, k)`, `_start(manifest,
  model, policies, yaws_deg, seed, commands, sites=()) -> (sim, settle, settle_points)` (`settle_points`:
  (settle steps + 1, len(sites), 3); `run_once` and `run_stage` take `sim, settle, _`), `_Sim(model, data,
  ducks, sites=())`, `_Sim.step/record/points(out)`, `run_once`, `run_stage`; `run_once` stops on the fall rule (trunk gravity z above `fall_gravity_z` for
  `fall_hold_s`), and `arena/stage.py fell_at(trace, termination)` reads the same rule off a
  `(frames, 21)` trace. The legs robot's `neck` body sits in `trunk_base` at `pos="0.026 0.0145 0.0324215"`
  (`arena/assets/robot/legs/robot_allcollisions.xml:181`); there is no site there today.
- Evaluation and records: `arena/evaluate.py` (`SeedResult`, `Evaluation`, `METRICS`,
  `evaluate`, `pick_trace_seed`); `arena/store.py` (`RunRecord`, `Store` protocol, `LocalStore`,
  `HubStore` with one `create_commit` per write and a tree-diff snapshot that excludes `*.mp4`,
  `*.png`, `votes/`); `arena/trace.py` (`encode(trace, settle)` float16 npz, `decode` →
  `(ducks, frames, 21)`).
- Ranking: `arena/index.py` `sort_key` (lower is better), `leaderboard`, `standing`;
  `arena/points.py` (`SCHEDULE`, `Receipt`, `receipts(…, now)` folds acts; podium points are held,
  recomputed per request); `routes_read.py:183` keeps votes on a separate path.
- Server: `arena/web/app.py create_app` (routers read, submit, auth, vote, unfurl, live, launcher;
  daemon threads `arena-clips`, `arena-commentary`, `arena-recover`, `arena-votes`);
  `ArenaConfig.from_env`. No wall-clock scheduler exists; clocks are injected (`now`) in pure
  modules, patched in route tests.
- Clips: `arena/clips.py` (`ClipRenderer.render_one(id)`, `ClipJobs` with `JOB_TRIES=3`, pending
  markers under `clips/<id>/`), `arena/recorder.py record_run(origin, run_id, …)` opens
  `clip.html?run=<id>&layout=<l>&frame=0`; front `app/src/clip/{main,plan,score,direction}.js`.
- Live: `arena/live.py` (`pool`, `cycle`, `slots_for`, `Programme(source, now_ms, book)` with
  slot kinds `shutter`, `replay`, `booth`; every slot length a multiple of 40 ms);
  `arena/broadcasts.py BroadcastBook`; `arena/commentary/` (`Fact`, `result_facts`, `notable`,
  `lore`, `generator.write(facts, drawn, …)` → 3–6 alternating turns, `stock.CommentaryStock`,
  `tab.PlanTab.prepare(dialogue)` → `window.plan` in `plan.html` → `live/score.js prepare`).
  Front `app/src/live/` (`channel.js` conductor, `replay.js`, `interlude.js` = booth segment,
  `booth.js`, `set.js` with the "pegboard" meshes, `captions.js`, `voice.js`, `score.js`).
  Nothing is said during a replay today.
- Front: hash router `app/src/router.js` (`parseRoute`, `*Href`, `themeFor`, `dress`),
  `main.js show()`, `api.js` (fetch wrappers; traces are float32 with `X-Duck-Count`),
  `format.js` (`formatScore(seconds, {finished})`, `isStage`), `course.js` (`buildCourse`; a lane's
  served `walls` are not drawn today; a tug's served `ropes` and `posts` are drawn by `tug-venue.js`), `viewer.js createViewer(...).setLanes(entries, event, opts)`,
  `replay.js applyFrame`, `rig.js`, `run.js`, `race.js`, `home.js` + `roundcard.js
  roundCard(event, rows, {number, corner})`, `player.js`. vitest + jsdom, no WebGL in tests.
- Tests: `tests/test_store.py make_record(**overrides)`; `test_routes_read.py client(tmp_path)` →
  `(TestClient, app)` from `ArenaConfig.from_env(store_dir=tmp_path, dev_user="coralie")`;
  `test_hub_store.py FakeHub`; the walker `arena/assets/policies/BEST_alpha_walking.onnx` via
  `load_policy`; `_ZeroPolicy` style fakes (`act(obs) -> np.zeros(14, float32)`).

## Plan A — names (as Plan G leaves them)

```python
# arena/manifest.py
CATEGORIES = {"race", "showcase", "versus"}
METRICS = ("mean_finish_time", "votes", "mean_ground_cm")
COURSE_KINDS = ("lane", "stage", "tug")
HIGHER_WINS = frozenset({"mean_ground_cm"})     # every other metric: lower is better

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Tug:
    ring_m: float         # rope to rope: the field is the square inside the ring's ropes, centred on the pit
    pit_m: float          # the pit's width along x, centred on x = 0, across the whole ring
    pit_depth_m: float
    string_m: float       # neck base to neck base, straight at the start
    kind: str = "tug"

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Rating:
    reference: str        # the reference duck: a file name in arena/assets/policies/
    pit_bonus_cm: float   # added when the reference ends in the pit, taken off when the entry does

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BoutRules:
    time_limit_s: float
    bouts_to_win: int
    max_bouts: int

# Manifest gains rating: Rating | None = None, bout: BoutRules | None = None. A tug: versus and mean_ground_cm, needs
# [rating] and [bout], its time_limit_s equal to [bout]'s; others refuse both.
def higher_wins(event_id: str) -> bool   # cached; True iff the event's TOML exists and its metric is in HIGHER_WINS
```

Validation: `course.kind == "tug"` ⇔ `category == "versus"` ⇔ `metric == "mean_ground_cm"`; a tug
requires `[rating]` and `[bout]` (its `time_limit_s` equal to `[bout]`'s), refuses `[sweep]` and
`[vote]`, requires `rig = "legs"`, refuses unknown keys in its `[course]`, `[rating]`, `[bout]`; its
`[course]` values are all positive and `pit_m < string_m < ring_m`;
any other event refuses `[rating]` and `[bout]`.

`arena/events/tug-of-war.toml` (Plan A creates it; Plan C adds `[cup]`; Plan B may retune
`[command]`, `[bout]` and `[rating]`, the parity test keeps both repos equal):

The reference duck's bytes ship with the Arena (`arena/assets/policies/tug-reference-t15-250.onnx`,
pinned by sha256 in `tests/test_assets.py`, recorded in `arena/assets/PROVENANCE.md`).

`arena score` on a tug (Plan F reads it): per seed
`f"seed {s}: {SIDES[entry_side(s)]:<4} {status:<8} {score_cm:+7.1f} cm at {time_s:.2f} s"`, then
`f"rating: {score:.1f} cm · replay from seed {n}"` (a minus sign when negative).

API: `event_summary` of a tug adds `course: "tug"`, `ring_m`, `string_m`, `pit_m`, `pit_depth_m`,
`ropes: [{name, from, to, radius}]` (12), `posts: [{name, from, to, radius}]` (4),
`bout: {time_limit_s, bouts_to_win, max_bouts}`, and `string_offset: [x, y, z]` until Plan G Task 6;
never `length_m`, `width_m`, `walls` or `pit`. `per_seed` items
carry `score_cm`; every board row carries `trace_seed`; a player's publications carry `metric`. `POST /api/events/{id}/submit` answers with the event's `metric` (every
event; the publish CLI reads it, Plan B's Task 13).

```js
// app/src/format.js
export const isTug = (event) => event?.course === "tug";
export function formatScore(value, { finished, metric } = {})   // "12.3 cm" for "mean_ground_cm"; seconds otherwise, as today
// app/src/tug.js — new (mirrors arena/tug.py; MJCF coordinates in, three.js out)
export function toThree([x, y, z])                  // [x, z, -y]
export const STRING_WIDTH = 51, MIDDLE = 8          // floats a frame (17 points × 3), the marker's point
export function stringAt(string, f)                 // frame f's 51 floats
export function tugString(entry, lead)              // a lane's string from where its ducks stand: its settle's last `lead` frames, then its trace
export const SIDES, BOUT_WORDS; export function entrySide(seed)   // mirror tug.py's SIDES, entry_side; REFERENCE (module-private) = {livery: "charcoal", name: "Reference"}

export function clipVerdict(run)                    // {stamp, pass}: stamps a tug's traced status; `clip/plan.js stampLane(run, laneCount)`
```

A tug lane handed to `viewer.setLanes` (one per call) is only
`{tug: "bout", ducks: [{trace, settle?, livery, name}, {…}], string: {trace, settle?}}` (west first; a
duck's trace is in world coordinates, so it needs no start; an optional `settle` plays before `trace`;
the string is the recorded one).

## Plan B — cross-repo names (as Plan G leaves them)

Plan B copies these Arena names into `microduck-challenges` (its job cannot import the Arena) and
pins each one with a parity test; the Arena must not change them without Plan B's copy. Plan H
makes the copies the ring and the string need: the lane's names (`wall_left`, `wall_right`,
`WALL_HEIGHT_M`, `LENGTH_M`, `WIDTH_M`) and the tendon's (`STRING` as the tendon, the tendon's range)
go out; in come the geoms `platform_west`, `platform_east`, `pit_floor`, `backstop_<side>`,
`rope_<side>_<k>`, `post_nw`, `post_ne`, `post_sw`, `post_se`; the ring's constants `RING_M`,
`RING_ROPES_M`, `RING_ROPE_RADIUS_M`, `RING_POST_RADIUS_M`, `RING_POST_TOP_M`; the string's
`STRING` (the prefix `"string/"`), `STRING_SEGMENTS`, `STRING_RADIUS_M`, `STRING_MASS_KG`,
`STRING_END_MASS_KG`, `STRING_DAMPING`, `STRING_ARMATURE`, `STRING_TIE_SOLREF`, `STRING_FRICTION`,
`MIDDLE`, and the names the string is built from (`string_sites` and `marker_x(string)`: the string's
middle point's x); and still `STRING_SITE`, `SPAWN_HEIGHT_M`, `WALL_THICKNESS_M`,
`PLATFORM_OVERRUN_M`, `string_offset("legs")`, `PIT_DROP_M`, `tug_layout`'s two starts,
`manifest.termination` (summaries only), the tug's `[course]`, `[command]`, `[start]`, `[bout]`,
`[rating]` and the reference duck's bytes. From Plan G Task 2's commit until Plan H Task 2 the
challenges' parity tests are red, by design.

A retune of `[command]`, `[bout]` or `[rating]` by Plan B is, in one sitting: a commit on the arena `versus`
branch (`arena/events/tug-of-war.toml`, its two Python suite calls green), the challenges'
constants, and both repos' parity tests green; C and D read the toml.

microduck_rl (Plan B's Task 13): `publish --enter` says a tug entry as
`[publish] entered on tug-of-war: a 12.3 cm rating → <page url>` (it reads the submit answer's
`score` and `metric`; metric `mean_ground_cm`).

Secrecy (`cup_view`): before `order.starts_at` (or with no order): number, times, state, entrants
ranked by rating — no groups, no matches, no secret. From `starts_at`: groups and fixtures; each
match's result, bouts and its effect on the tables and the bracket only from its reveal
(`revealed_at`: the moment its clip has finished airing); the champion and the `secret` only from
the final's reveal. Its clip media and its call come `PREFETCH` before it airs, and a desk segment
`PREFETCH` before the reveal it may mention (Plan D), so the live can buffer them; nothing else is
early. Tests pin cup #1 to 2026-10-30 themselves (the owner sets the shipped `first` at release).
States: `"open"` (before close), `"drawn"` (closed, not ready),
`"ready"` (order fixed, before the start), `"airing"`, `"aired"`, `"skipped"`.

Store (Plan C), dataset layout `cups/{event_id}/{number:04d}/`: `draw.json` (everything but
`matches` and `order`; written first, so a restart recomputes the same cup from its secret),
`matches.json`, `bouts/{match_id}-{k}.npz` (`trace.encode`; `HubStore` leaves them out of its snapshot
and `cup_file` fetches one when it is read), `order.json`, and Plan D's `show.json`.

```python
# Store protocol, LocalStore, HubStore
def put_cup_files(self, event_id: str, number: int, files: dict[str, bytes]) -> None  # one commit; refuses a name that exists
def cup_file(self, event_id: str, number: int, name: str) -> bytes | None
def cup_numbers(self, event_id: str) -> list[int]
```

```python
# arena/cupworker.py — new
def entrants_at(records, withdrawn: frozenset[str], close_at: datetime, runner_version: int = RUNNER_VERSION) -> list[Entrant]
#   each user's latest run submitted at or before close_at, not withdrawn, on runner_version;
#   sets each entrant's on-air `name` (two entrants with one policy_name air under their handles)
def compute_matches(manifest: Manifest, cup: Cup, load: Callable[[Entrant], object]) -> tuple[Cup, dict[str, bytes]]
#   plays every match (groups, then each knockout round from the last), returns the cup with
#   `matches` and the bout trace files
def running_order(cup: Cup, clips: Mapping[str, float], starts_at: datetime, show: dict | None = None) -> dict
#   clips: match_id -> its landscape clip's seconds; Plan C ignores `show`, Plan D fills it
def load_cup(store, event_id: str, number: int) -> Cup | None
def all_cups(store) -> list[Cup]                       # every event with a [cup], each cup in number order
def load_entrant(store, entrant: Entrant) -> Policy    # from the Hub at its revision, or the store's copy
class CupWorker:
    def __init__(self, store, clips, *, events, load, now=lambda: datetime.now(UTC), log=print,
                 show: Callable[[Cup, dict], dict] | None = None): ...
    # show(cup, partial) writes the show (Plan D), filling `partial` as it goes, resumed next tick
    def tick(self) -> None    # close → draw.json → matches → owe clips → (D: write the show) → fix the order
    # the draw waits DRAW_GRACE (60 s) past the close, entries still those stamped at or before it
    def start(self) -> None   # daemon thread "arena-cups", tick every 30 s
    def stop(self) -> None
```

The worker fixes the order only when every match clip is ready (and, from Plan D, the show is
written: it is written once every match clip is ready), with `starts_at = max(premiere_at, now + 10
min)`; a cup never gets an order while the previous cup of the event has not finished airing.

Running order segments (times relative to `starts_at`, every length a multiple of 40 ms). The
grid is served 5 minutes ahead, so a shutter's `next` names the stage, never a duck; a match
segment carries no clip version (the live adds `clip` from `clip_state` when it lays the slot):

```json
{"kind": "shutter", "at_ms": 0, "duration_ms": 1600, "next": {"match_id": "…", "title": "Group C"}}
{"kind": "match", "at_ms": 1600, "duration_ms": 41240, "match_id": "…"}
```

Clips of matches: the clip id is the match id. `mark_clip_pending(match_id, "arena", event_id,
queued_at)`. `record_run(origin, clip_id, …)` opens `clip.html?match=<id>` when
`is_match_id(clip_id)`, and films it in the landscape layout only. `ClipJobs` never gives up on a match id (`JOB_TRIES` is for runs): a match job
that ends with nothing written fails its clip at once, and the cup worker launches a failed match clip
again every `CLIP_RETRY`.
`ArenaConfig.reveal_all` (set by `arena clip`, never on the Space) lets the job's loopback app read
unrevealed matches. A match clip's `clip.json` layout `timing` carries
`bouts: [{"k", "tape_start_s", "tape_end_s", "hold_end_s"}]` (where each bout's timed trace sits in the
mp4, and where the 6 s hold on its last pose, `BOUT_HOLD_S` in `app/src/clip/match.js`, ends).

API (Plan C, `arena/web/routes_cups.py`, `now()` read per request, patched by tests):
- `GET /api/events/{id}/cups` → `{"next": {"number", "close_at", "premiere_at", "entrants": [...]}, "cups": [{"number", "premiere_at", "starts_at", "state", "champion"}]}`
- `GET /api/events/{id}/cups/{number}` → `{"event", "open", "min_entrants", **cup_view(cup, now)}`
- `GET /api/matches/{match_id}` → the match once revealed (404 before): `{match_id, event, cup, round, group, title, a, b, bouts, wins, winner, decided_by, clip}` (`a`/`b` are `Entrant.view()`, `winner` `"a"`/`"b"`)
- `GET /api/matches/{match_id}/bouts/{k}/trace`, `…/settle` (float32, `X-Duck-Count: 2`) — 404 before the reveal.
- `GET /api/matches/{match_id}/bouts/{k}/string` (the string's wire, see Plan A; Plan G Task 5) — 404 before the reveal.
- `GET /api/matches/{match_id}/clip/{name}` (a clip file) — 404 before `airs_at − PREFETCH`. No route says where a
  match's clip stands: the match page reads `clip` off the match, the live off its slot.

Live (Plan C): `pool(store, now)` (`now` required: the programme and the commentary stock pass it)
adds the matches of every cup that has finished airing, until the event's next cup starts; a match
entry (`Entry.title` set) is announced by `{"match_id", "title"}`, plays its match clip and gets no
booth broadcast, and `CommentaryStock` skips every `is_match_id` entry. `shows(store, now) ->
list[Show]` gives every cup not skipped that has not finished airing (`Show(premiere_ms, starts_ms,
ends_ms, slots, standby)`; `starts_ms` and `ends_ms` are None while it has no order).
`Programme(source, now_ms, book, cups=...)` lays a cup's segments at their absolute times; the cycle
before it ends with a `standby` slot that fills to `starts_at`, from the premiere at the latest:
`{"kind": "standby", "at_ms", "duration_ms", "cup": {"title"}}`. Past its premiere a cup with no
order yet is "starting soon": standby slots of `LATE_STANDBY_MS` (60 s) carrying `"late": true`,
whose card gives no time, until the order lands (at least `ORDER_LEAD` ahead, beyond the grid).
A match segment is served as `{"kind": "replay", …, "run_id": <match id>, "clip", "media": "match"}`;
`clip` is None while its clip is not ready (deleted to be rendered again): the screens hold the
shutter's panel over it.

Points: `receipts(…, cups: Sequence[Cup] = (), now)`; acts `cup_champion` 250, `cup_final` 150,
`cup_semi` 100, counted from the final's reveal; `source_id` = the deciding match id.
`GET /api/players/{user}` adds `cups: [{event_id, event_title, number, starts_at, reached}]`
(`reached`: `"champion"`, `"final"`, a round name, or `"group"`), each cup from its final's reveal, newest first.

Running order with the show (`running_order(…, show=…)`): an `opening` desk segment first; per
match: its `intro` desk segment, Plan C's `shutter` (naming the stage only), the `match` segment
with `"call": true`; after the last match of each group round a `shutter` with `"next": null` and
its `recap`; after the final a `shutter` with `"next": null`, the `ceremony`, the `close`. Desk
segment: `{"kind": "desk", "at_ms", "duration_ms", "segment": "<id>", "after": i}`.

Live API (Plan D): `GET /api/live/show/{event_id}/{number}/{segment_id}` → `{dialogue, plan,
screen}`, served from `revealed_at(matches[after]) − PREFETCH` (the opening: from `starts_at −
PREFETCH`); `GET /api/live/call/{match_id}` → `{lines, plan}`, served from `airs_at(match) −
PREFETCH`; 404 before, and for anything the show does not hold; both of a cup's event only, and
served whole under `reveal_all`. Slots:
`{"kind": "desk", …, "show": {"event", "number", "segment"}}`; a match replay slot carries
`"call": true`.

export function singCaption(plan, caption, sing, out)     // replaces synthesize: one caption's notes, mono 48 kHz, into `out`
// app/src/live/voice.js: start(plan, offsetMs) sings one mono AudioBuffer per caption still to come, each
//   SING_AHEAD_MS (2 s) before it plays, all started on the context's clock from one instant (memory held = the
//   speech, not the plan's length); stop() stops them all and sings none still to come
// app/src/api.js

//   pegboard's place; standScreen(set, shown) stands it in place of the pegboard, or the pegboard back
// app/src/live/booth.js: one booth on the live page (Ruling F): createBooth(canvas) owns a SCREEN_PX canvas;
//   prepare(commentary, posterUrl | null) draws commentary.screen (a desk segment's view) and stands it, a
//   commentary without one stands the pegboard back; a poster is loaded only when given one
